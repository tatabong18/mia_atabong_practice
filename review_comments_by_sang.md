# Review comments by Sang

We are going to use this as a basis for
weekly 1-1.

## April 13 (Thursday)
- .gitignore is missing
- "employee-app"
  - Employee class is in the wrong package (minor)
  - "employee-app" resulted in null pointer exception
  - "employee-app" part #2 code is there

## April 17 (Monday)
- employee_app is done with part #5
- Use of enhanced for-loop in the Department class would have been
  better coding practice now since you use
  an ArrayList object rather than an array
- Employee class is still in the wrong package (minor)
